## 🎯Project Overview

          - Overview
          Boltrswap is an automated liquidity protocol powered by a constant product formula and implemented in a 
          system of non-upgradeable smart contracts on the Kucoin Community Chain (KCC). Our foundation known as Boltr with 3 members right now
          is on research on its development.It obviates the need for trusted intermediaries, prioritizing decentralization,
          censorship resistance, and security. Each Boltrswap smart contract, or pair, manages a liquidity pool made up of reserves
          of two KRC-20 tokens.
