## üßë‚ÄçüíªBasic information

  * Project Name: Cowswap DEX

  * Team Name: stakecow

  * Payment Address: 0x5B5D5d96B72869E10267B72FBc74ab0346168151

## üéØProject Overview

### Overview

Cowswap is limit orders based and trading driven DEX. All orders share the traded amount pro-rata.

### Project Details

Uniswap is an AMM DEX based on formula `x * y = K`. Uniswap is good, but people need limit order DEX too. So we are creating a new limit order DEX. All the orders will be matched according to the price when trading, like traditional exchange. All orders with same price will form the order pool, all orders share the traded amount and maker fee pro-rata.. The protocol will charge a fee of 0.2%. The fee will be divided two parts, 50% will be distributed to order's owner, and 50% will be kept by team.
